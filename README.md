# LiveryChanger
Adds new liveries to GeoFs aircraft <br>

<br>

**To Use:**<br>
Method 1: copy and paste the code of `index(1).js` into the console.<br>
Method 2: create a bookmark with the code in `Bookmark.js` set as the URL. When you click the bookmark it will run. This is good for those who cannot access the console.<br>
<br>

Note: It is best to select the base aircraft, then when it loads in select the additional liveries. Otherwise the liveries will not work.
